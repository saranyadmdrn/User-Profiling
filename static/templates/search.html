      <ul>
        <li> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ and https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming have been crawled. </li>
        <li> Scrapy is used for crawling the website. It scrapes the content on the page and stores it into a csv file.</li>
        <li> Scrapy first scrapes all the links on the main page. Then, it iterates through each link. Under each link, the subsections of the
             page is scraped separately.</li>
        <li> The csv file stores the url of the page where the content is present, the topic under which the content appears and the content</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead">How Indexing?</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Elastic search is used for indexing the crawled content.</li>
        <li> The csv file generated from crawling is used for indexing. </li>
        <li> The script will populate the elasticsearch index from the file. Index are created on subsections of the page that has been crawled. </li>
        <li> bulk() api helpers are used to index these large datasets. </li>
        <li> bulk() api helper consumes an iterator of actions and sends them to elasticsearch in chunks. </li>
        <li> When a search is made, elasticsearch is queried to return all the relevant content. </li>

<button ng-click="getValue($event)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Inheritance is when a 'class' derives from an existing 'class'.So if you have a Person class, then you have a Student class that extends Person, Student inherits all the things that Person has.There are some details around the access modifiers you put on the fields/methods in Person, but that's the basic idea.For example, if you have a private field on Person, Student won't see it because its private, and private fields are not visible to subclasses.Polymorphism deals with how the program decides which methods it should use, depending on what type of thing it has.If you have a Person, which has a read method, and you have a Student which extends Person, which has its own implementation of read, which method gets called is determined for you by the runtime, depending if you have a Person or a Student.It gets a bit tricky, but if you do something likePerson p = new Student();p.read();the read method on Student gets called.Thats the polymorphism in action.You can do that assignment because a Student is a Person, but the runtime is smart enough to know that the actual type of p is Student.Note that details differ among languages.You can do inheritance in javascript for example, but its completely different than the way it works in Java.">Post 2</button>

<button ng-click="getValue($event)" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different types in a similar manner.Example: Giraffe and Crocodile are both Animals, and animals can Move.If you have an instance of an Animal then you can call Move without knowing or caring what type of animal it is.Inheritance: This is one way of achieving both Polymorphism and code reuse at the same time.Other forms of polymorphism:There are other way of achieving polymorphism, such as interfaces, which provide only polymorphism but no code reuse (sometimes the code is quite different, such as Move for a Snake would be quite different from Move for a Dog, in which case an Interface would be the better polymorphic choice in this case.In other dynamic languages polymorphism can be achieved with Duck Typing, which is the classes don't even need to share the same base class or interface, they just need a method with the same name.Or even more dynamic like Javascript, you don't even need classes at all, just an object with the same method name can be used polymorphically.">Post 3</button>

These classes are known as Synthetic Classes or Dynamic Proxies. See for more information.
